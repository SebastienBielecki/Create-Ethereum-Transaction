# Create-Ethereum-Transaction
Example of how to create an Ethereum transaction, on Ganache and on a Testnet


*** WORKING ETHEREUM TRANSACTION WITH GANACHE ***
run indexGanache.js with node.js

*** WORKING ETHEREUM TRANSACTION WITH GOERLI TESTNET ***
run testNetSolution.js with node.js

*** SIMPLER ETHEREUM TRANSACTION WITH GOERLI TESTNET ***
I tried to implement a simpler way, however it's not working. Feel free to suggest solution.
run indexTestnet.js with node.js
